---------------------------------------------   
BEST PRACTICES FOR CREATING STRONG PASSWORDS:
---------------------------------------------
1. Use a Mix of Character Types: Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols in every password.
2. Ensure Sufficient Length: Use passwords that are at least 12–16 characters long.
3. Avoid Common Words: Don’t use names, dictionary words, or simple sequences like 123 or abcd.
4. Avoid Repeating or Sequential Characters: Repetitions (aaa) or sequences (1234, abcd) lower password strength.
5. Use Symbols Creatively: Replace letters with symbols (@ instead of a, $ instead of s) to add complexity.
6. Avoid Personal Info: Do not include birthdates, names, or easily guessable data.
7. Change Passwords Regularly: Especially for important accounts, update them every few months.
8. Use a Password Manager: To store and generate strong, unique passwords for each site or service.
9. Don’t Reuse Passwords: Always use a different password for every account or platform.

---------------------------------
TIPS LEARNED FROM THE EVALUATION:
---------------------------------
1. Only lowercase passwords are very weak, even if long (e.g., surajkish scored just 10%).
2. Uppercase-only passwords like SURAJKISH scored low due to lack of variety.
3. Adding numbers improves scores moderately (suraj123 scored 39%).
4. Combining uppercase, lowercase, and numbers gives a decent score (Suraj123 got 58%).
5. Including a symbol like in Suraj@123 significantly boosts the score to 78%.
6. Strong combos of all character types (e.g., $Ur@j!2025) pushed scores above 85%.
7. Random long strings with high entropy (e.g., &zM!9hK@uL3*BfQw) reached 98%, showing excellent strength.

RESEARCH ABOUT COMMON PASSWORD ATTACKS:
---------------------------------------
1. BRUTE FORCE ATTACK:
   - An attacker tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.
   - Time-consuming but effective against short or simple passwords.
   - Defense: Use long passwords with varied characters; enable account lockouts after failed attempts.
---------------------
2. DICTIONARY ATTACK:
   - Uses a predefined list of common words and phrases (like “password”, “123456”, etc.) to guess the password.
   - Very effective against passwords that use simple, common words.
   - Defense: Avoid real words or names; add random characters.
-----------------------
3. CREDENTIAL STUFFING:
   - Attackers use leaked username-password pairs from one service to access accounts on others.
   - Defense: Don’t reuse passwords across sites.
-----------------
4. HYBRID ATTACK:
   - Combines dictionary and brute force methods (e.g., tries "password1", "Password123!").
   - Defense: Use unpredictable patterns and symbols.
----------------------
5. SOCIAL ENGINEERING:
   - Tricks the user into revealing their password using phishing or other deceptive tactics.
   - Defense: Be cautious of suspicious emails, links, and messages.
   
-----------------------------------------
HOW PASSWORD COMPLEXITY AFFECTS SECURITY:
-----------------------------------------
1. Higher complexity = greater resistance to brute force and dictionary attacks.
2. Passwords with mixed character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) take significantly longer to crack.
3. Longer passwords exponentially increase the number of combinations needed to guess correctly.
4. Unpredictable passwords (not based on real words or patterns) reduce vulnerability to dictionary and hybrid attacks.
5. Simple or reused passwords are easy targets and commonly exploited in cyber breaches.
